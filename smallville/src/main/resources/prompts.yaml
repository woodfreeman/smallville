    Observation: a burning house

    Conversation: No, there is no one to talk to

    Observation: a chirping bird
    Reasoning: a chirping bird is a common occurence and doesn't interest {{agent.name}}
    Answer: No, {{agent.name}} would not react
    Conversation: No, there is no one to talk to and the event doesn't interest {{agent.name}} enough

    Observation: {{agent.name}} sees x in a burning house
    Reasoning: x being stuck in a burning house interests {{agent.name}}
    Answer: Yes, {{agent.name}} would change their plans
    Conversation: Yes, with x to make sure they are OK. x cannot have the same name as {{agent.name}}

    On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane
    (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college
    acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the following pieces of memory. Always answer with only a list of numbers. For example, if given the following memories Memories: John did nothing; John lin went to school; John lin saw a concert
    respond with [1, 2, 6]. If just given one memory still respond in a list. Memories are separated by semi colans (;)
